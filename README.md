## Purpose

This module can:

* parse simple commit message of the type `type(scope): message`
* validate a given message if it fits the above simple format
* guide the user with questions in order to form well formatted message

## Valid commit messages

### Simplest

```
major: breaking change in API
minor: this is a new feature
fix: an example fix message
```

### Synonyms

For convenience you can use synonyms:

* "break: ..." is synonym to "major: ..."
* "feat: ..." is synonym to "minor: ..."
* "patch: ..." is synonym to "fix: ..."

### Scopes

You can optionally put a *scope* for the commit. For example if you added
a new feature to the `log` feature of the module

```
feat(log): added colors!
```

Similarly, you can add scope to each type

```
major(scope): breaking change in API
minor(something): this is a new feature
fix(login): an example fix message
```

### Skip release

If you just want to commit code, but not publish a new version from CI, you
have several choices.

```
chore(tests): writing more tests
WIP: work in progress, not ready yet
```

**note** if you have local commit message validation as a Git hook, for
example using [pre-git](https://github.com/bahmutov/pre-git#readme)
skip the message check using `git commit -n` option.

### Comments

The commit message can have lines that start with `#` character. These
lines will be ignored.

## Install and use

    npm install --save simple-commit-message

Then use the following methods

```js
var simple = require('simple-commit-message')
simple.name // "simple"
// returns an object with parsed info
const result = simple.parse(message)
/*
  {
    firstLine, // first message line
    type,      // "major", "feat", "fix", "chore" or undefined
    scope,     // inside of round braces
    subject    // message after :
*/
// returns true / false, prints errors to given log function or console.error
simple.validate(message, log)
// message wizard built on top of inquirer
simple.prompter(inquirer, cb)
// returns true if the commit message is public ("feat", etc)
simple.isPublic(
  simple.parse("feat(foo): add foo feature").type
) // true
```

See [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for details.

## As plugin for semantic-release

This module can function as [analyzeCommits plugin](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#analyzecommits)
for [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
Just add to the [configuration file](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#configuration-file)

```json
{
  "analyzeCommits": "simple-commit-message"
}
```

### Versions

* `1 ... 3.x` compatible with `semantic-release` v8
* `4` compatible with `semantic-release` v11

## Wizard

This module comes with included "bin" script that runs the wizard and asks you the questions.
To use, add a script to your package, for example name it "commit"

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "commit": "simple-commit-message"
    }
}
```

Then instead of `git commit` use the command `npm run commit` and answer questions.

## Related

* [conventional-commit-message](https://github.com/bahmutov/conventional-commit-message)
is based on AngularJS log standard and has more commit types allowed.

## Debugging

To see the commit processing logic locally, run

```sh
GH_TOKEN=aaa NPM_TOKEN=fff $(npm bin)/semantic-release pre || true && git checkout .npmrc
```

This will trigger local commit analysis without publishing.

To see debug log messages run this plugin with `DEBUG=simple` environment
variable.
